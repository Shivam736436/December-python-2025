# how loops work on String, Tuple, Set, and Dictionary in Python

# loop in string

# a="shivam" 
# for b in a:
#     print(b)

#  if you want to count vowel in word

# s = "Shivam"
# count = 0

# for ch in s:
#     if ch in "aeiou":
#         count += 1

# print("Vowels:", count)


# loop in tuple

# a=("shivam", "archana", "anuradha", "Shivani")
# for b in a:
#     print(b)



# loop in set
